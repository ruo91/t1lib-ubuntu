t1lib (1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Twiddled package names to make more sense.
  * Move back to priority optional to satisfy dependencies of xpdf and
    php3.
  * Moved .la files to t1lib-dev.  Added versioned Replaces: field in the
    control file to cope with potato-to-potato upgrades (the t1lib0
    packages in slink were not buggy in this way)
  * t1libconfig and associated manual pages (FontDataBase.5,
    t1libconfig.8) are now in the t1lib-bin package, for much the same
    reason.  Unfortunately this Replaces: field cannot be versioned.
  * The t1lib packages no longer manage the contents of /etc/t1lib/.  In
    the near future, t1lib1 may have a debconf interface for doing so.
    The t1lib.config and FontDataBase were never used by any programs that
    linked with t1lib anyway, thankfully.

t1lib0 (0.9.1-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Updated the shlibs file since it appears that programs compiled
    against 0.9.1 won't work with 0.9 (though the other way around does
    work).  Fixes: #43215, #43231
  * Removed ARCH bogosity and updated config.sub and config.guess
    (upstream maintainer will be notified)

 -- David Huggins-Daines <dhd@debian.org>  Sat, 21 Aug 1999 01:23:39 -0400

t1lib0 (0.9.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Oops.  T1lib installs a dummy config file.  We remove this before
    building the package (because we generate our own).  Also, the preinst
    has to compensate for the past brokenness by saving it before an
    upgrade.

 -- David Huggins-Daines <dhd@debian.org>  Fri,  2 Jul 1999 16:13:46 -0400

t1lib0 (0.8.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.  (fixes bug #31549)
  * Upstream move to libtool has made debian/rules a lot less contorted,
    and slimmed up the diff considerably.  Thanks!
  * I'm now uploading m68k versions as well.
  * Fixed "confdif" typo in t1libconfig (oops!)
  * This release breaks binary and source compatibility.  Bumping the
    soname seems a bit extreme, since there is only one Debian package
    (gglyph) which depends on this, and I'm simultaneously uploading a
    fixed version.

    anything, and is relatively stable.
